#Check for Wordpress versions on server and current version
#e.g. curl knife.so/wordpress | sh

#First we set up some variables - like the version number oulled from the API
ver=$(curl  http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.1/ -silent | tail -1)
GREEN='\033[1;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
#Then we output the current version and check our installs against it
echo "The current version of WordPress is: "
printf "${GREEN}$ver${NC}"
printf "\n"
echo "The following outdated versions were found on the server"
for i in $(locate version.php | grep wp-includes); do grep -H "wp_version = " ${i}; done | grep -v "$ver" #loop through all wp installs and output version
